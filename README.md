# OpenCanopyIcons-CC0
This repository contains sets of individual icons intended for use with the OpenCanopy GUI frontend for [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).
The files are in Apple .icns file format and contain only images sized 128x128px and 256x256px.

<i>These icons were released under the CC0 license and are copyright free</i>

The idea is that a user can choose to select one or more icons from this collection to enhance their GUI experience. They can either replace images that are already in their OpenCanopy's /Resources/Image directory, renaming the icons from here with the same name, or rename the icon from here as .VolumeIcon.icns and place at the root of the volume as a hidden file, and adjusting the PickerAttributes in config.plist accordingly.

Please note that the 'sets' here refer to the style of the design and are not complete sets of images that can be directly used in OpenCanopy's /Resources/Image directory.

For details about how to use these then please consult the [OpenCore configuration documentation PDF](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf).
